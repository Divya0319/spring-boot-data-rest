# Spring Boot Data REST
A demo Spring boot app, built using Spring Data REST, which further minimized boilerplate REST code for basic endpoints of the entity.

It performs CRUD operations based on endpoints, and using HTTP methods, GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.

The application has no frontend portion, just the backend, returning data in the form of JSON, or if some error occurs, it throws the exception.

### One advantage of Spring Boot Data REST is that, we don't need to create a REST controller for basic endpoints for basic methods like : 
    Fetching all entities
    
    Fetching a single entity by id
    
    Update an entity by its id
    
    Delete an entity by using id
    
We get these methods in respective  GET, POST, PUT and DELETE endpoints.
